# NuroFlow

NuroFlow is a small catalog site for neural networks, which I was unable to download so that you can have a convenient link to it, so you need to download the archive to fully download the site to your PC (about 2 GB) Sorry, but for me there are a lot of complex monolithic files! :> (it is also mostly in Russian)

Just run: start-nuroflow.bat
